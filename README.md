# Developer Profiles

## Powershell

A PowerShell profile is a script that runs when PowerShell starts. You can use the profile as a logon script to customize the environment. You can add commands, aliases, functions, variables, snap-ins, modules, and PowerShell drives. You can also add other session-specific elements to your profile so they are available in every session without having to import or re-create them.

## VS Code

These are user specific settings and can be overriden if a `settings.json` file exists inside `<workspace>/.vscode/`.

These settings apply globally to any instance of VS Code.

## Windows Terminal

User specific settings for customizing Windows Terminal. The settings are grouped under four headings:

1. Global: Settings that apply to the whole application e.g. Default profile, initial size etc.
2. Key Bindings: Actually a sub field of the global settings, but worth discussing separately
3. Profiles: A group of settings to be applied to a tab when it is opened using that profile. E.g. shell to use, cursor shape etc.
4. Schemes: Sets of colors for background, text etc. that can be used by profiles
